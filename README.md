# Picture Captioning

### Abstract
In this project, I will implement an end-to-end Deep Learning model for Image Captioning. The architecture consists of Encoder and Decoder Networks. Encoder is one of the pre-trained CNN architectures to get image embedding. Decoder is LSTM network with un-intialized word embeddings.
